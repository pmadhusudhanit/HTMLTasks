    <h2>Story</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>

        Abhiram(NTR) is an young entrepreneur based in London. One fine day, he comes to know that his father(Rajendra Prasad) is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and is in his last stages of life. An upset Abhiram, rushes back home to confront his dad.
        
        During this time, Abhiram’s father reveals that his last wish is to see Krishnamurthy(Jagapathi Babu), the richest Indian in UK gets defeated in life. He further reveals to Abhiram how Krishnamurthy had ripped of his property and happiness by cheating him big time. Rest of the story is as to how Abhiram dethrones Krishnamurthy and fulfills his father’s dying wish.</p>

    <h2>Plus Points</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>With Nannaku Prematho, NTR stuns you with his emotional performance. This is probably NTR’s best performance till date as the young tiger has unleashed a new side of his caliber. Right from the first frame, NTR nails it with his stylish looks and classy act. He is exceptionally good and carries his emotions with right balance. NTR needs to be appreciated for coming out of his comfort zone and accepting a film like this.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<hr>
<p>On the whole, Nannaku Prematho is a film where all the unnecessary commercial aspects are put aside and the focus is on the content. NTR’s solid performance and emotional content are huge assets. However, the slow pace of the film and lack of certain elements which are expected by NTR fans and mass audience will hamper the collections to an extent. Finally, Nannaku Prematho is a class act which should do well only with the A center audience.</p>
